# Smartphone Price Classification 📱🤖

This project was developed as part of an **Artificial Intelligence course** at **Ain Shams University (ASU)**.  
The goal of the project is to build and evaluate machine learning models that can **predict the price range of smartphones** based on their specifications.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Smartphone pricing depends on multiple features such as RAM, battery capacity, internal storage, camera quality, and more.  
In this project, we apply **data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning classification algorithms** to predict the smartphone price category.

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- Understand the full **machine learning pipeline**
- Handle **data cleaning and preprocessing**
- Avoid **data leakage**
- Train and evaluate different ML models
- Analyze model performance using **classification reports and confusion matrices**

---

## 📂 Dataset

- The dataset contains smartphone specifications and a target label representing the **price range**.
- Target variable: `price`
- Features include hardware and technical specifications.

> ⚠️ Note: All preprocessing steps were applied **after splitting the data** to avoid data leakage.
